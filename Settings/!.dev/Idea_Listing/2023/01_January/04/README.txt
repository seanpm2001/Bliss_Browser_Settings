Considering: Talla Browser -> Bliss browser (for QMeadows)

At least 6x more customizable than Firefox
Too customizable?
A browser that is so customizable, you can completely take it apart just with settings in the GUI alone
So customizable, you can change enough settings to make it stop functioning entirely if you wanted
Problems with adoption: The most lax restrictions, no DRM support (I find this to be a good defining feature, it makes the system completely free software, but I know it will hurt adoption, as streaming services will refuse to operate here, and the websites that add poor Firefox support are likely to add even poorer/less support for this browser) still, I will keep going with it like this
Other

Note [2022.12.27] idea generation has significantly slowed down in the past 3 days (for reference, the first 3 days of jotting down ideas brought in over 3000 entries, averaging over 1000 per day) but new ideas are still coming in daily (currently at a rate of below 10 per day) Right now, I am adding in ideas that come to me, notably ideas for improvements based off the shortcomings of Firefox in situations like outages, loading times, and more.

OS Mode

Inspired by/based on Meadows WebMode: https://github.com/seanpm2001/Meadows_WebMode/

ℹ️ OS Mode turns your web browser into an operating system, in a similar manner to an operating system of a netbook, such as FirefoxOS, ChromeOS, ChromiumOS, and others. It basically turns your computer into a netbook while it is active. Your operating system will be completely unaffected by this, all files will remain in tact, and turning OS mode back off will let you go back to your system just the way it was originally. It is basically a shell that locks over your normal desktop, ~~similar to how Windows 95 was just a shell running on top of MS-DOS~~
