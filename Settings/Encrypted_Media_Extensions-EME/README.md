# Encrypted Media Extensions/EME (forbidden)

EME (Encrypted Media Extensions) is a more common form of DRM. As such, it is not allowed on this project.

DRM is not supported by the Bliss Browser for ethical reasons. Inclusion of DRM would also violate the projects license.

I am hoping to get this browser approved by the Free Software Foundation (FSF) but that isn't the only reason DRM is not included.

1. DRM is not user friendly
2. DRM is proprietary
3. DRM would violate this projects GPL3 license
4. DRM fails completely at preventing copying, but it is brilliant at preventing innovation (not my quote, I can't find the original author right now)
5. DRM is bad for the environment
6. [Copying is not theft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Copying_Is_Not_Theft.webm) [`OGV version`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Copying_is_not_theft.ogv)
7. and many more reasons...

Not including DRM is going to hurt this browsers marketshare in the beginning, as streaming services like Hulu, Disney+, Netflix, and others are just going to refuse support.

Additionally, going as far as to disclude EME (Encrypted Media Extensions, another form of DRM) will make most sites not want to adopt, and will cause further restrictions, such as sites like YouTube, Twitter, Reddit, and others to refuse to allow access to the browser, as nothing will be "copy protected"

I don't care too much about how sites are going to react, I just know marketshare is going to stay below `001.00%` for a very long time.

- [x] Disable Encrypted Media Extensions (default)
- [x] Mark EME-enabled sites as not safe (default)
