OS Mode

Inspired by/based on Meadows WebMode: https://github.com/seanpm2001/Meadows_WebMode/

ℹ️ OS Mode turns your web browser into an operating system, in a similar manner to an operating system of a netbook, such as FirefoxOS, ChromeOS, ChromiumOS, and others. It basically turns your computer into a netbook while it is active. Your operating system will be completely unaffected by this, all files will remain in tact, and turning OS mode back off will let you go back to your system just the way it was originally. It is basically a shell that locks over your normal desktop, ~~similar to how Windows 95 was just a shell running on top of MS-DOS~~
